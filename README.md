# recipe-app-front

# Required technologies:

- Visual Studio Code
- Node 14.0.0 or higher
- Npm 5.6 or higher

# Installation

### 1. Backend

* Firstly ensure, that Backend part of application launched and all microservices work correctly. 

### 2. Frontend Launch

*Remark.  All of below actions you can do in plain PowerShell terminal. I just find it more easy and faster to launch it in VS Code*

* Open `recipe-app-front` folder with VS Code
* Open project terminal in VS Code.
* In terminal write command `npm install` and wait.
* After successfull completion, run command `npm start`
* Once frontend will be launched you will see message like `webpack compiled with 1 warning` and the page will automatically open in the browser
